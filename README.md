# eForms_NRSA
This repo holds the updated NRSA code that should allow users on Shiny.io to upload JSON files from the NRSA app, parse and 
organize the data into tables. Then the user can output the data into an Excel file with worksheets for each dataset or a 
zip file of comma-delimited files of data.
